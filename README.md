# henrik-cra-starter

This is a boilerplate based on create react app, preinstalled with packages and configuration that I commonly use.

Notable differences over the default create react app starter:

- Using typescript + tslint
- Prettier for auto-formatting everything
- styled components instead of css imports
- react-app-rewired used for hot reloading and styled components
- react-router preinstalled
- some additional npm scripts, mostly for linting
